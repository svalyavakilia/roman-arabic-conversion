# Roman-Arabic (and vice versa) conversion
## How to use
Type in either Roman or Arabic number and the output will be created accordingly
(if the input is in Roman then the output will be in Arabic and vice versa). The "Copy the output!" button allows
you to copy the output to clipboard fast and easy :wink:.
## Range
You can type any Arabic number in range from 1 to 3999 or any Roman number in range from I to MMMCMXCIX.
